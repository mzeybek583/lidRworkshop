# Read the file exercise_atlantic_forest.laz


# What does it contain? Is the ground segmented? What are the different point classes?
# Is it normalized? What is the point density? What is the point format? What is the difference
# with the file we used during the workshop


# Normalize the file.


# There are some obvious ouliers below 0. Drop them.


# Now the point cloud is clean, what do you observe? How do you explain that? Do you think it is a
# good idea to normalize the dataset?


# When ploting the original dataset, points are colored by their absolute height. When plotting the
# normalized dataset the points are colored by their relative height but the topography is no longer
# visible. Find a way to display the non-normalized data but colored with the relative height.


# Segment the trees by any mean you want. This segmentation should not run in more than 1-2 seconds.


# Is this segmentation good enough? How to impove it? Test another algorithm. Is it a good idea to process
# non-normalized data? What to you propose to improve these results?
